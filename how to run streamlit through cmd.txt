how to fix when i cannot run my streamlit through the vscode:

1.  USE CMD
2. find streamlit ( if it's already installed or not):
	pip show streamlit
3. if it's notr installed:
	"C:/Users/Nasywa Kamila/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/python.exe" -m pip install streamlit
	(use the path of your python)
4. if it's already installed, then jjust run it through cmd (again)
	python -m streamlit run "D:\Tubes AI\tubesstreamlit.py"
